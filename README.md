# ASLingual
## Overview

ASLingual is a deep learning software powered by **Convolutional Neural Networks** (CNN) and R**ecurrent Neural Networks** (RNN). Using **Python's TensorFlow** framework, ASLingual is trained with several datasets of ASL **(American Sign Language)** signs and sequences to provide accurate, real-time captions.


ASLingual uses the spatial recognition capabilities of **CNNs** to identify individual sign gestures accurately. Each sign is converted into a high-dimensional vector space, allowing the model to discern even subtle differences in gestures.
